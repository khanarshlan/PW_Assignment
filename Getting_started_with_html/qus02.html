comments in HTML - HTML comments serve as a means of annotating and documenting code to enhance comprehension, especially for collaborating developers. These comments serve to elucidate the purpose and functionality of specific code sections, alleviating the need for newcomers to delve deep into the codebase for understanding. Essentially, HTML comments provide a form of inline documentation that aids in code readability, debugging, and collaborative development efforts.
