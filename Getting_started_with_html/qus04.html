    <!-- HTML tags are predefined elements in HTML represented by angular brackets, such as "<h1>". These tags are enclosed by angle brackets, with an opening tag using the greater-than sign followed by the less-than sign and a closing tag containing a forward slash after the less-than sign, like "</h1>". These tags are fundamental for structuring and formatting content in HTML documents.-->

                <h1> this is an example of opning and closing tag </h1>

    <!-- HTML elements encompass both the opening and closing tags, along with any content enclosed within them. For instance, consider the "h1" element, which comprises an opening tag ("<h1>"), its corresponding closing tag ("</h1>"), and the textual content residing between these tags, as illustrated in the previous example. In technical terms, an HTML element embodies the entire hierarchical structure used for defining and organizing content within an HTML document. -->
