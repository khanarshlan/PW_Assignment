HTML entities : 
              HTML entities are special character codes used in HTML to display characters that have a reserved meaning or are not easily typed on a keyboard. They are represented by an ampersand (`&`) followed by a code or a name, and then closed with a semicolon (`;`). Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

1. `&lt;` - Less Than Sign (`<`): Used to display the less than symbol ("<") in HTML without it being interpreted as the beginning of an HTML tag.

2. `&gt;` - Greater Than Sign (`>`): Used to display the greater than symbol (">") in HTML without it being interpreted as the end of an HTML tag.

3. `&amp;` - Ampersand (`&`): Used to display the ampersand character ("&") in HTML without it being interpreted as the start of an HTML entity.

4. `&quot;` - Double Quotation Mark (`"`): Used to display double quotation marks (") in HTML, especially within attributes of HTML tags.

5. `&apos;` - Apostrophe or Single Quotation Mark (`'`): Used to display single quotation marks (') in HTML, especially within attributes of HTML tags. Note that this entity is not as commonly used as the others, and in many cases, you can use the actual character without encoding it as an entity.

These HTML entities are crucial for displaying special characters correctly and ensuring that your HTML code is properly parsed by browsers.
