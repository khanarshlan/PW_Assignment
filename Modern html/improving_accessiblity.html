Here are three ways to improve the accessibility of HTML:

1. **Use Semantic HTML Elements:**
   - Utilize HTML's semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` appropriately to give structure and meaning to your content. These elements help screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the document's organization.

2. **Provide Descriptive Text Alternatives:**
   - Always include alternative text for images using the `alt` attribute in `<img>` tags. Write clear and concise descriptions that convey the purpose or content of the image. For complex graphics, charts, or diagrams, consider providing long descriptions using techniques like `aria-describedby` or `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements.

3. **Use Proper Heading Structure:**
   - Structure your content with a logical heading hierarchy (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.). Ensure that each section or subsection has a unique and descriptive heading. This aids navigation and comprehension, especially for screen reader users.
