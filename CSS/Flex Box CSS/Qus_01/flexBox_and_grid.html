CSS Flex Property (Flexible Box Layout):

CSS Flex is used for one-dimensional layouts, aligning elements along either the horizontal (x-axis) or vertical (y-axis) axis.
By default, the x-axis is the main axis, and the y-axis is the cross-axis, but you can change and reverse them using other Flex properties.
Flex is useful for creating simple layouts and can also handle more complex designs, but many developers prefer CSS Grid for complex layouts.
Flex provides control over the arrangement of items within a container, distributing space efficiently, and handling alignment.
It's a great choice for creating flexible and responsive designs, especially for things like navigation bars, card layouts, or centering elements.

CSS Grid Property (Grid Layout):

CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, enabling you to create complex layouts with rows and columns easily.
Grid simplifies the creation of complex layouts, and it's particularly useful when you need to define precise placement for elements in both directions.
Grid provides more structured control over the layout, making it easy to create grid-based designs.
It has widespread browser support, making it a powerful choice for building responsive and intricate layouts.
Grid is especially beneficial for designing grid-like structures, such as multi-column websites or aligning elements in a more structured manner.
