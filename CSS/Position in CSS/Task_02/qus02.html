Absolute and relative positioning in web design and CSS differ in their reference points, impact on document flow, behavior during scrolling, overlap with other elements, and use of z-index:

*Reference Point**:
  - Relative Positioning: Positioned relative to their normal position or nearest positioned ancestor.
  - Absolute Positioning: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block (viewport if no ancestor).

*Document Flow**:
  - Relative Positioning: Occupies space in the document flow, affecting other elements.
  - Absolute Positioning: Removed from the document flow, doesn't affect layout.

*Overlapping Elements**:
  - Relative Positioning: Can overlap with other elements and affects surrounding elements.
  - Absolute Positioning: Can overlap without affecting the layout.

*Scroll Behavior**:
  - Relative Positioning: Scrolls with containing elements.
  - Absolute Positioning: Fixed in position relative to the viewport, doesn't scroll.

*Z-Index**:
  - Relative Positioning: Controls stacking order within the normal stacking context.
  - Absolute Positioning: Creates a new stacking context, allowing precise layering.
