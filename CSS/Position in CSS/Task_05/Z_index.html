`z-index` is a CSS property that controls the stacking order of elements in the vertical (z-axis) dimension on a webpage. It's often used to determine which elements should appear in front of or behind others, especially when elements overlap.

Here's an example of how `z-index` works with HTML and CSS:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .box {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    position: absolute;
  }

  #box1 {
    background-color: red;
    z-index: 2;
  }

  #box2 {
    background-color: blue;
    z-index: 1;
    left: 50px;
  }

  #box3 {
    background-color: green;
    z-index: 3;
    left: 100px;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="box" id="box1"></div>
  <div class="box" id="box2"></div>
  <div class="box" id="box3"></div>
</body>
</html>
```
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In this example:
- We have three `<div>` elements (`.box`) positioned absolutely.
- Each box has a different background color and a `z-index` value that determines the stacking order.


- `z-index` values can be positive or negative integers, with higher values appearing in front of lower values.
- The red box (`#box1`) has the highest `z-index` (2), so it appears in front of the other boxes.

- The blue box (`#box2`) has a lower `z-index` (1) and is partially covered by the red box.

- The green box (`#box3`) has the highest `z-index` (3), so it appears in front of both the red and blue boxes.

The stacking order is determined by the `z-index` values, and elements with higher values are layered on top of those with lower values. If two elements have the same `z-index`, their order in the HTML source determines which one appears on top.

It's important to note that `z-index` works when an element's `position` property is set to a value other than `static` (e.g., `relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed`). Elements with `position: static` cannot have a `z-index` applied to them.
