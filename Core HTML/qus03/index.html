<!-- 
Here are the changes made:

1. Added missing closing `</p>` tags.
2. Corrected the text for better readability.
3. Closed the `<main>` and `<div>` tags.
4. Ensured proper spacing and punctuation.
5. Removed unnecessary line breaks.

Now, the code is well-formed and should display properly in a web browser. -->
