A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small icon or image associated with a website or web page. Favicons are typically displayed in a web browser's address bar, next to the page's title in browser tabs, and in bookmarks or favorites lists. They serve as a visual representation of a website and help users easily identify and recognize the site when multiple tabs are open or when browsing bookmarks.

Here's an illustrative example of how to add a favicon to an HTML document:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Example Website</title>
    
    <!-- Add Favicon -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to Example Website</h1>
    <p>This is the content of our website.</p>
</body>
</html>
